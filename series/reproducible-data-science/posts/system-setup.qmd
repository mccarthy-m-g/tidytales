## Prerequisites

The following will install, build, and configure the tools used in the remaining posts in this series (and some other things). This is my personal setup for macOS and is intended to get a new computer up and running with the tools and preferences I like to use. A lot of this is general to any data science setup on macOS, but some of it is specific to me.

You are free to use or modify this for your own setup, but should do so thoughtfully. Don't run any of the scripts below without understanding what they do, and backup your system if you are trying this on an existing setup. To test drive my system setup safely, consider using a virtualized instance of macOS with [UTM](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM).

## Before you begin

My system setup is done mainly done through the shell prompt in Terminal, which is the easiest recommended way to get a shell prompt on macOS. You can find Terminal in the Utilities directory inside your Applications directory.

If you have never used Terminal before, Apple has a nice [shell scripting primer](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/OpenSource/Conceptual/ShellScripting/Introduction/Introduction.html) and [command line primer](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/OpenSource/Conceptual/ShellScripting/CommandLInePrimer/CommandLine.html) book in their archives.

### Installing Xcode command line tools

Xcode command line tools are needed to build certain packages from source. The command line tools provide a lighter alternative to installing the [full Xcode release](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the App Store, which contains a lot that isn't needed for data science use cases.

Install Xcode command line tools from the Terminal with:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Installing Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an open source package manager for macOS that makes installing, removing, and managing software simple.

Install homebrew from the Terminal with:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Installing chezmoi

[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) is an open source dotfile manager. Dotfiles are hidden files and hidden directories that store preferences and settings for packages and applications. Dotfiles can be made visible in Finder with the **Command-Shift-.** keyboard shortcut.

Install chezmoi from the Terminal with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install chezmoi
```
