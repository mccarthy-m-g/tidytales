## Zotero

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is an open-source reference manager that styles itself as "your personal research assistant."

If you are using another reference manager you should switch to Zotero, full stop. It's easy to [migrate your data from other reference management tools to Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/moving_to_zotero), and will [improve your workflow](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/01/08/bibdesk-to-zotero-pandoc/).

### Installing Zotero

Install Zotero from the Terminal with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask zotero
```

### Installing Zotero Connector

[Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) is a browser plugin that allows you to save web content (blogs, articles, etc.) to Zotero with a single click.

The Zotero Connector for Safari is bundled with Zotero. You can enable it from the Extensions pane of the Safari preferences.

## Use custom PDF resolvers

Zotero also supports [custom PDF resolvers](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/custom_pdf_resolvers) for automatically retrieving PDFs from other sources when Zotero can’t find or access a PDF. You can find some useful examples in Brenton Wiernik’s [zotero-tools](https://github.com/bwiernik/zotero-tools/blob/master/engines.json) repository, or by searching something like “zotero pdf resolver” in your favourite search engine.

### Installing Zotero extensions

These are the core extensions I use with Zotero. See their documentation for installation instructions:

- [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/)
- [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com)

I also use:

- [scite](https://github.com/scitedotai/scite-zotero-plugin)
- [PubPeer](https://github.com/PubPeerFoundation/pubpeer_zotero_plugin)

You can find more extensions on the [Zotero website](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins).

### Configuring Zotero preferences

As far as I'm aware, it isn't possible to configure [preferences](https://www.zotero.org/support/preferences) in Zotero with dotfiles, so this has to be done manually.

The main preference I need to configure is the [citation key formula](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/#configurable-citekey-generator) for Better BibTeX:

```md
authEtAl.lower+"_"+shorttitle(3,3)+"_"+year
```

Which means:

- Last name of the authors (with et al. for references with three or more authors)
- An underscore
- First three words of the reference's title in camel case
- Another underscore
- Year of publication (if any)

I use this over a `authEtAl.lower+"_"+year` citation key formula because the titles are a helpful reminder of what I'm citing. However, this citation key formula can make the markdown of a document hard to read, particularly when there are multiple citations in the same sentence or paragraph.

### Zotero for iOS

[Zotero for iOS](https://www.zotero.org/support/ios) is an open source application for working with your Zotero library on an iPad or iPhone. Install it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zotero/id1513554812).

## Configuring Zotero

Things to do after installing Zotero and extensions.

### Cloud syncing

Use Zotero's [sync functionality](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync) to sync your Zotero library across devices. Zotero syncing has two parts:

- Data syncing
- File syncing

**Data syncing** syncs library items, but doesn't sync attached files (PDFs, images, etc.). Set up data syncing in the Zotero app by signing into your account.

**File syncing** syncs attached files of library items. Files can be synced using either:

- [Zotero Storage](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync#zotero_storage)
- [WebDAV](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync#webdav)

**WebDAV** is a standard protocol for transferring files over the web and can be used to sync files in your *personal library*. There are a number of [WebDAV storage providers known to work with Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/webdav_services).

**Zotero Storage** is the file sync option recommended by Zotero. Zotero Storage includes all the features of WebDAV syncing, plus file syncing in group libraries, web-based access to file attachments, easier setup, and guaranteed compatibility.

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## WebDAV or Zotero Storage?

I currently use WebDAV syncing through [4shared's](http://www.4shared.com/features.jsp) free plan, which gives me 15 GB of free space. I chose this option because I don't need any of the additional features of Zotero Storage, and 15 GBs is more than enough for my personal library.

## Using Zotero for citations in Quarto and R Markdown documents

Quarto and R Markdown can use Pandoc to automatically generate formatted citations and bibliography entries in a number of citation styles, specified with a `CSL` file. The open source [**Citation Style Language**](https://citationstyles.org) (CSL) project maintains a crowdsourced [GitHub repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) with over 10,000 free `CSL` citation styles.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Use CSL JSON for bibliography files

The native format for Pandoc's citation processor, `citeproc`, [CSL JSON](https://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html) and it is essential to use `.json` formatted bibliography files to get correctly formatted citations and bibliography entries. All other bibliography file types (e.g., `.bib`) are internally converted to CSL JSON---a [complex and often lossy process](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/pandoc/#use-csl-not-bibtex-with-pandoc) that can result in incorrectly formatted citations.
:::

There are two options for generating a bibliography file from Zotero personal or group libraries in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) and [R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/citations.html):

- RStudio's [native Zotero integration](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/citations.html) (visual editor only)
- The [**rbbt**](https://github.com/paleolimbot/rbbt) R package (works anywhere)

I prefer rbbt because allows you to generate a CSL JSON bibliography file dynamically from a Quarto or R Markdown document, rather than using a persistent file. To insert citations in a document interactively I use rbbt's "Insert Zotero Citation" RStudio addin from a custom **Alt-Command-R** keyboard shortcut.
