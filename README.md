# Tidy Tales

Tidy Tales is a data science blog inspired by [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly data project for practicing and building data science skills with real-world data. My contributions to Tidy Tales demonstrate the skills needed in a typical data science project:

- Data wrangling
- Data visualization
- Statistical modelling
- Communication
- Programming

See [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) for a great resource on learning these skills.
