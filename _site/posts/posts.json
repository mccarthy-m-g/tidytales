The games have a dramatic comic book art style that I want to capture in my plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: In-game screenshot from Borderlands 3.\n\n\n\nGearbox, the developers of Borderlands, have explained that this art style is achieved using “hand-drawn textures, scanned in and coloured in Photoshop, combined with software that draws graphic novel-style outlines around characters and objects, sharpens shadows to look more like something an artist might create, and even draws lines on hills and inclines. Finally the character models are all revamped with more exaggerated proportions, creating the appearance of a detailed comic book in motion.”\nSome of these are not relevant to plotting, but two are:\nDrawing graphic novel-style outlines\nUsing hand-drawn textures\nTheming Inspiration\nThe in-game menus in Borderlands 3 provide a great design reference for plot theming.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The ECHO-3 in-game menu in Borderlands 3.\n\n\n\nI want to translate these design elements to my plot like so:\nThe Compacta Bold font can be used for plot text.\nThe blue background and light blue UI highlights can be used for the plot background and axes, respectively.\nThe white header text can be used for the plot title, and the blue text can be used for other textual elements of the plot.\nThe loot rarity colours can be used for grouping data in plot geoms.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Loot in Borderlands (guns, grenades, shields, etc.) are colour categorized by the rarity with which they can be found in containers or dropped by defeated enemies. From left to right the categories are: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary.\n\n\n\nApplying these elements to my plot will help it fit the Borderlands aesthetic.\nR\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\n\nI’ll be using Steam player data for my plot. The data contains statistics for the average and peak number of players playing a variety of games each month from July 2012 to February 2021. You can download this data with the Data Source code in the appendix.\n\n\n# Load the weekly data\ngames <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"2021-03-16_games.csv\"))\ngames\n\n\n#> # A tibble: 83,631 x 7\n#>    gamename            year month     avg    gain   peak avg_peak_perc\n#>    <chr>              <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>        \n#>  1 Counter-Strike: G…  2021 Febru… 7.41e5  -2196. 1.12e6 65.9567%     \n#>  2 Dota 2              2021 Febru… 4.05e5 -27840. 6.52e5 62.1275%     \n#>  3 PLAYERUNKNOWN'S B…  2021 Febru… 1.99e5  -2290. 4.47e5 44.4707%     \n#>  4 Apex Legends        2021 Febru… 1.21e5  49216. 1.97e5 61.4752%     \n#>  5 Rust                2021 Febru… 1.18e5 -24375. 2.24e5 52.4988%     \n#>  6 Team Fortress 2     2021 Febru… 1.01e5  18083. 1.34e5 75.7603%     \n#>  7 Grand Theft Auto V  2021 Febru… 9.06e4 -10603. 1.46e5 61.9017%     \n#>  8 Tom Clancy's Rain…  2021 Febru… 7.24e4  -5335. 1.13e5 63.8645%     \n#>  9 Rocket League       2021 Febru… 5.37e4  -5726. 1.03e5 51.9419%     \n#> 10 Path of Exile       2021 Febru… 4.69e4   -766. 9.05e4 51.8229%     \n#> # … with 83,621 more rows\n\nWrangle\nI only want data from the mainline Borderlands titles for my plot, so let’s get those.\n\n\n# Filter to mainline Borderlands titles available in the data.
